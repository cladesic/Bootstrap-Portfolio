          <p>My name is Charles Ladesic, I’ve been in support for over 27 years that include telecommunications to
            Information Technology. Early in my career I spent 9 years installing, programming, and project management
            in the telecommunication industry. The remaining 18 years was various positions at Verizon which included
            monitoring alarms in the Network Operation Center “NOC” to support and development in Application Support.
            During this time I obtained my Associate and Bachelor degree in Informational Technology of Arts. Along the
            way I’ve gained several friends and professional mentors that have assisted me in my career goals.</p><br>
            <p>I’m currently continuing with my education to refresh and learn new programming languages/methods that will
            further my career in becoming a full time developer. I enjoy working or solving issues that occur in
            applications and find ways to improve or correct the issue in both reactive and proactive. My current job
            role is working on Zero-Touch automation, which is to take the human aspect out of repeating processes that
            can be automated. My career has provided me with some great knowledge through trial and error, along the way
            I found reading log files can save several hours or isolation.</p>
